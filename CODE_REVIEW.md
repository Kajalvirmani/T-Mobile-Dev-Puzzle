CODE_SMELL

# Observables are not unsubscribed which would cause memory leak.

# Reducers (failedRemoveFromReadingList, confirmedRemoveFromReadingList, failedAddToReadingList, confirmedAddToReadingList) were not handled for reading list.component.

# Spinner/Loader is required at the time of API calls to enhance user experience.

# Instead of subscriptions we can use async pipe.

# In Books.service.ts file, there is no proper error handling if API is not responding.

# The use of innerHTML creates a potential security risk for your website. 




ACCESSIBILITY

AutomationScans:-

# Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.

Manual Scans:-

# Missing alternative text on images.

# Buttons do not have an accessible name.

# In BookSearch component,"JavaScript" anchor element is not clickable with tab. So, we can replace it with some other native element like button.
